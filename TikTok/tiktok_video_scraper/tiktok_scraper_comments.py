    To set up this scraper, please follow these steps:

    1. Open a new terminal and enter the following command: git clone https://github.com/cubernetes/TikTokCommentScraper
    2. Locate the git repository on your local computer.
    3. Open the git repository and find the folder named "TikTokCommentScraper".
    4. Enter the folder and double-click on "Copy JavaScript for Developer Console.cmd".
    5. Open the TikTok page in Chrome, log in, and find the video from which you want to extract comments.
    6. Right-click with your mouse and enter developer mode.
    7. Click on the "Console" tab and paste the copied code into the console.
    8. Press "Enter" and allow the code to run. Upon completion, the data will automatically be copied to your clipboard as a long string.
       Attention: Before Step 8, you should make sure you can SCROLL the comments 
    9. Return to the local git repository and click on "Extract Comments from Clipboard.cmd".
    10. You can now find all the comments in the newly created Excel file.

    Note:
    1. Use the Chrome browser.
    2. Don't worry if there's a discrepancy between the number of extracted comments and the number displayed in the comment count; TikTok may not update the count when comments are deleted.
