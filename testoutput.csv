There was SO MUCH they could have done. And our expectations were extremely low. But repeatedly, they put more and more barriers in the way of her getting help. Their goal was fixing the relationship between her and her parents. Not, you&#39;no- HELPING AN ABUSE VICTIM. They used so much victim blaming, kept redirecting things onto how WE could be better. How WE could be less angry. How we could be a &quot;light&quot; in their household. I want to fucking puke. All we wanted if for someone to be there and listen. That&#39;s fucking it. But no. Okay, so for a little extra context, my ex was very (rightfully) afraid of telling anyone about her situation, because if the wrong person found out. THEY&#39;D TELL HER PARENTS. So, I went through the effort of telling people what was going on, and gauging their reactions to see if they could be trusted. But repeatedly, they told me there was NOTHING to be done unless SHE came forward on her own. That&#39;s a load of shit. Yes, it&#39;s best to hear about this stuff first hand. But that&#39;s not always an option. All I wanted from them, was to tell me they wouldn&#39;t report this to her parents, and to walk up and ask her if everything was okay. This is also what my ex wanted, because it&#39;s really hard to come out and say this stuff. And they repeatedly refused saying something along the lines of &quot;I&#39;m not really the kind of person to go and pressure you to fix your problems.&quot;. And what&#39;s worse? HER MOM&#39;S A FUCKING YOUTH LEADER. SHE&#39;S THERE TO FEEL BETTER ABOUT HERSELF AND TO SPY ON HER 17 YEAR OLD ADOPTED CHILD. THIS PIECE OF SHIT&#39;S TEACHING THE &quot;word of god&quot; TO TEENAGERS. God, there&#39;s so much more but I wanted to write this down because I still doubt myself on whether or not it&#39;s fair to expect better of the church I used to go to. I&#39;m in so much pain because of this. On the bright side, completely ignoring the massive dark side for a moment, it did lead me towards seeing the flaws in my faith. So that, along with several other traumatic experiences stacked on top, forced me to reconsider my faith. I&#39;m so glad I did, Christianity controlled me through fear.

,,,,"Warning: Obnoxiously long comment ahead<br><br>I do a lot of thinking about issues like these. At times, it legitimately hurts watching videos like these solely because I can hardly stand hearing fundamentalist preachers babble on about things they refuse to understand. I‚Äôve been digging through content like this for years now, developing an understanding of how conservatism and religious fundamentalism are intimately connected, and how the social structures and cultural influences they produce are designed to benefit those who already possess tremendous institutional power. Even when their ideas sound good on the surface, I‚Äôve come to realize that nearly any good idea can be corrupted. It is saddening, how often I hear from people who were deeply hurt by these institutions. It is painful just thinking about how easy, how obvious some of the solutions are, yet how difficult it is to implement them on a societal level considering the dogmatic opposition to positive reform.<br>It is cruel beyond belief to deny someone the right to feel. While not all emotions are essentially desirable (people don‚Äôt often like to be sad), everyone should be able to process these feelings on their own time. No one asks for trauma. No one asks for pain. Ever since I can remember, I‚Äôve defined forgiveness as the ability to finally release these pent up sentiments. The hatred, the grief, the anger, to release it all to the wind, and find peace with yourself at last. That is how I understand forgiveness. It isn‚Äôt something that can be forced. It isn‚Äôt something to shake someone for struggling with. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsinful‚Äù to be angry. Anger (and hatred too) are a part of being hurt sometimes, and I cannot blame someone for having this natural reaction. Heck, people do everything in their power to make peace with themselves and often fail. I doubt you‚Äôll find many people who want to die thinking only of the people they hate. At that, there is even research that demonstrates a connection between chronic anger/aggression and heart disease.<br>I‚Äôve had my own share of trials in life, and if I‚Äôve learned anything, it‚Äôs that why someone does something is often just as important as what they are doing. That is why we cannot dismiss the feelings of anyone, especially those who have experienced abuse or mistreatment. Healing cannot occur without a compassionate understanding of those who have been wronged. This is what fundamentalism lacks. I wish all those who are currently struggling internally with past trauma a safe recovery. Your feelings are 100% valid.",UCiGsDyiSh5z8LGmOT1lisQA,2023-05-21T05:19:36Z

No one should feel guilty if they can&#39;t, but for one&#39;s own sake, you should try to forgive those who wronged you. Not because they deserve it, but because holding on to anger only hurts you, it does not affect them in any way, and they do not deserve to have the abillity to continue to hurt you, you don&#39;t have to tell them, you do not have to let them back into your life. Forgiveness is for you, not the person you are forgiving. It lets you heal, move on, become stronger. Forgive but learn from the pain that you felt, and do not let it happen to you again, and do not let it happen to others.",UCNWc-xJXI1c8QRmp8ySuEaA,2023-04-05T22:34:44Z

He hurt us a lot, and in response, I feared my own anger because I never wanted to hurt anyone else the way he hurt me. It has taken me a long time to coming around to accepting this emotion in myself and recognising that it&#39;s presence in me is a neutral act - it simply lets me know when a boundary of mine has been crossed and that can be good for recognizing injustice. It&#39;s a normal emotional response. What changes it from neutral into being a bad or a good thing is how manage those emotions and how I express that anger. <br><br>So, the preacher (Mark Clark) at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_-kjctRjUs&amp;t=20m10s"">20:10</a> and I agree.

When I was still catholic and taking part in CCD, I remember being taught about the deadly sins. The way it was explained to me was that none of the sins are inherently bad; it&#39;s only when they&#39;re taken to the extreme that they become &#39;sinful&#39;. They told the Jesus in the temple story, where he goes apeshit on the people selling things and doing business in a sacred place, and how that exemplified righteous anger. It was taught to me that it is good to be angry in situations of injustice, so long as we aim that vector in a direction that continues to follow our morals. I don&#39;t believe in the catholic version of right and wrong anymore, but I think that&#39;s one message that stuck with me, and that I continue to apply to my new life view.

The Bible says, &quot;be angry and sin not&quot;, (Eph <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_-kjctRjUs&amp;t=4m26s"">4:26</a>-31) which tells us that anger and sinning are two separate things. The confusion occurs because there&#39;s a close connection between anger and MALICE, this being the decision to initiate destructive actions against another person. It seems to me it&#39;s MALICE that&#39;s the sin, because anger at injustice is not a sin unless one takes the law into one&#39;s own hands. MALICE, like DISHONESTY, isn&#39;t listed as a sin although a little thought tells us they are both involved in nearly every sin it&#39;s possible to commit. The lack of DISHONESTY&#39;S inclusion in the seven sins is difficult to justify because (John 8:44) tells us &quot;the Devil is the father of all lies&quot;. (Revelations 21:08; 21:27; &amp; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_-kjctRjUs&amp;t=22m15s"">22:15</a>) say that &quot;no liars get into heaven&quot;, so these seven sins are at odds with scripture, and are not intrinsically Christian.

He would abuse you. <i>Maybe taking your virginity from you...&quot;</i><br>I literally said out loud &quot;Excuse me?!?!&quot; üò®üò®üò®ü§®ü§®ü§®<br><br>I&#39;m a rape survivor and to say that someone being raped counts as them &quot;losing their virginity&quot; is just fucking mind blowing how fucking ignorant that is and it makes me sick.<br><br>If you&#39;ve ever heard Elizabeth Smart talk about her kidnapping and multiple rapes, and how she would remember a BS purity culture &quot;lesson&quot; at her church. Her youth pastor did the old metaphor of &quot;your body is like a piece of gum, each time someone &quot;chews&quot; you (aka has sex with you,) you lose your flavor (aka worthiness as a woman.) Each time Elizabeth was raped and abused, she emembered of that purity cultge and thought, &quot;who&#39;s going to ever want me after this.&quot; <br><br>This is an example of what happens when purity culture runs rampant, thabuse/rape victims feel even more alone, thinking they&#39;ll never find a happy relationship in their future because they feel like they&#39;re &quot;damaged goods.&quot; That&#39;s completely heartbreaking and absolutely horrifying. It&#39;s disgusting and vile that Elizabeth Smart&#39;s church never even addressed the difference between rape and sex and didn&#39;t mention that the metaphor wasn&#39;t applicable in the instance of rape. üòñüò§üò†<br><br>We know, scientifically, that &quot;virginity,&quot; in a physical sense, isn&#39;t really something that&#39;s standard across the board. If you&#39;re talking about breaking the hymen, well, many women break theirs doing everyday things long before ,they have sex for the first time. Inserting and wearing a tampon can break the hymen (mine did this way lol.) You can break the hymen while horse riding, exercising, bike riding, doing gymnastics, inserting a finger, getting a pap smear/pelvic exam, etc... <br><br>Having an intact hymen doesn&#39;t prove someone is a virgin. You can literally even have sex and <b>still have an intact hymen.</b> So physically speaking &quot;virginity&quot; isn&#39;t really a thing as it&#39;s usually tied to the hymen being intact equaling virginity and that&#39;s just n<br>ot true.<br><br>So, if not physical, then virginity is a more abstract state of being, simply a label to whether or not you&#39;ve had sex. Rape IS <b>NOT</b> SEX. Sex is between 2 willing participants and anyone who says rape is &quot;having sex&quot; is either unknowingly ignorant of science, or willfully misrepresenting rape as sex because they don&#39;t value a woman&#39;s bodily autonomy which 100% is true about many religious people.<br><br>Let me be absolutely clear here. <br>If you are a virgin, and then you are raped, you are still a virgin after the rape because the rape quite obviously wasn&#39;t your choice, it happened against your will. If a virgin is raped, that should NEVER EVER be equated with &quot;losing your virginity.&quot; <br>It disgusts me to no end that people will call rape &quot;having sex&quot; or say that a virgin who gets raped is no longer a virgin. ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨<br>That is complete and utter bullshit.

,,,,"I spent most of my life having dealt with trauma by shutting down my emotions. I never felt the threat of a god or hell hang over me because I never believed it, even as a child surrounded by Christians, but I was brutally bullied in school<br> As a result of that, plus my life philosophy to just do good, I never learned <i>how</i> to be angry. I forgave everyone. I didn&#39;t hate anyone. Anger was shameful. I found solace in believing everyone has good in them and everyone is capable of redemption. A lot of people took advantage of me because of it. To be honest, I still feel that way and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wrong to want the best for everyone... but I&#39;ve gone to counseling and rediscovered a lot of emotions I suppressed, including anger. I&#39;ve learned how to hold people responsible for their mistakes so that they can&#39;t take advantage of my kindness. When I&#39;m angry at someone else for my own sake, I still feel shame, but I am able to let it out. I feel human again.<br><br>And I&#39;m no longer suicidal.<br><br>I guess the best way to explain it is that I can sense my own feelings better now. Before, it was bottled up and would burst out every few years into a mess, or the depression would seep slowly into my life and make me feel okay with, you know, turning the steering wheel a bit too hard on the bridge on the way to work one day.

If we avoid the feeling of anger, we will only further dig ourselves into a space where we do not belong, where we don&#39;t wanna be. <br><br>It is just so damn convinient that it would also keep us in a religion that sells this myth about an anger-less life.

I&#39;ll have to paraphrase what his answer was, since I unfortunately can&#39;t find where I put the sheet. Basically, his response was that we don&#39;t have to force ourselves to forgive someone, or pretend like what they did to us never happened.

I have been repelled from churches and preachers just because of things like this. He&#39;s quoting Romans chapter 1, the conclusion of that chapter is that certain people who knowingly and willfully sin should be put to death. However, Paul right before he says this says those who are unloving unforgiving unmerciful unkind these are the people that should be put to death. Somehow these people selectively read this passage and single that out (the mention of homosexuality) instead of what the author is actually saying. I&#39;m not defending homophobia, I&#39;m just disgusted at how blind people can be to the passage that they&#39;re using to support their own ideology. <br><br>And then, go on to the first verse of the second chapter and it begins that you are inexcusable whoever you are who judge for you practice the same things. This is just one example of how people take this book out of context to make it say things that it isn&#39;t saying. Again I&#39;m not defending the book, I&#39;m just so frustrated with people who have no understanding of the book but stand on a platform as if they do. Not only is there textual context that has to be considered, but also historical and cultural context. Our problem is lazy thinking and tribalism.<br><br>And finally, if anyone cares, read that passage for yourself and you&#39;ll see that Paul is drawing a comparison between humans having a relationship with God, the creation and the Creator, and the male-female relationship. What he is saying is that it is unnatural for created things to worship created things in the same way that according to Paul it would be unnatural for same-sex relationships to go on. In other words, man and God are two parts of a complimentary whole just as male and female are when it comes to reproduction, when it comes to actually creating life in a natural way. The sin that he talks about in that chapter is all about not recognizing God as God, not worshiping God, not keeping God in your thoughts, those three things and the judgment that comes from those things.<br><br>If anyone cares to go further, you can jump right over to chapter 3 where Paul says there is none that are righteous not even one. Got the whole world is guilty in the eyes of God, again, not to support the ideology or the toxic shame that might come from it, but if you look at the effect man has on this planet it would seem that all he can do is destroy his environment and if God was one, the oneness of all things, it might be accurate to say that humanity is guilty of self-destruction, of sin. <br><br>Yuck",UCr2kq0k1xGpckXVKhE8mrXw,2023-01-11T20:01:27Z

You do not force power onto others without fearing it being done to you. If someone had stopped them earlier, then they could have grown into better, happier people. To me, the best way to help with this is to remove power in all levels. Have no lords, only neighbors. If everyone is on equal ground, the chance and harm of abuse decreases dramatically. Then a push to genuine, loving, and accepting therapy to help for the rest. If there are people who can not be neighbors, if there truly are people who must live by harming, then that&#39;s sad, and they deserve care too. Maybe they need to be in a separate environment, but it would be one equally as good as everyone else&#39;s, because they are not sinners still.<br><br>But these politics are not what these preachers believe and would call me hateful for promoting when everything I believe comes from thinking about people in their current situation and all I want is for everyone to live better.

I think what makes this that much more frustrating and disappointing is that these sermons are <b>just</b> left field of smth that could be constructively helpful for someone who may feel like forgiveness is suitable for their situation...I like the idea of second chances and reconciliation, and harboring anger/resentment can really eat someone up internally, in which forgiveness can be an outlet for the wronged. But! Some major differences b/w being merciful to someone who earnestly deserves it and these pastors&#39; ideals are - being forced to maintain a connection w/ someone who&#39;s let you down, the lack of acknowledgement in the first place for how they&#39;ve hurt you, and the journey to work for a better change or rehabilitation to earn that forgiveness. They&#39;re trying to morph an extensive emotional process into a singular action of responsibility, and imo its misplacing the energy to give a person the opportunity change for the better and instead making the wronged person feel shameful for the hurt they bear. This only perpetuates an unhealthy threshold of tolerance someone is willing to put up w/ for the sake of keeping the peace or &quot;not stooping to a lower level&quot;, and any lesson abt the importance of self preservation is lost to an ancient ideation/an attempt to &quot;be the better person&quot; (sometimes this comes off to me as an ego response to cope w/ pain from someone you loved or trusted) (cont.)",UCJxi5vqN_PpCnRSCDUYV7Zg,2023-01-11T16:46:22Z

Forgiveness is not something anyone is entitled to, especially to those who have reaped destruction on innocent lives.  And when forgiveness is demanded from the victims when they&#39;re not ready or are still rightfully angry and hurt, it tells them that the pain that they feel and the wounds that have been given to them doesn&#39;t matter, and that they just need to suck it up and act like it never happened.  Real forgiveness takes time, it takes the guilty party truly realizing the damage that they have done to you and working to make amends, and the choice of the victim to give that forgiveness or not. Don&#39;t let anyone ever shame , guilt trip, or fear bomb you into forgiving them. I can&#39;t thank you enough trevor for these videos that you do.

,,,,"2 things on this. I was conditioned to be polite. Not really from my parents...well kind of not. My mum is a very polite lady and treats people with a lot of respect...and I like to emulate that to...but also through years and Years of retail and not wanting to rock the boat in nursing as well...that unhealthy anger didn&#39;t come from thr emotion itself. It came from suppressing it. From being too polite. That toxic anger used to not really hurt anyone but myself. Until I had kids. It was small steps at first...but when I had small people that I needed to take care of 24 hours a day I could not have this unhealthy anger. <br>I learnt this lesson again...very recently. I had to accept my mother in laws abuse...she didn&#39;t talk to me for 15 years of my relationship with my partner, not until I had kids and because she had the &#39;right&#39; to see her grandchildren, I had to stay in her house as to not offend her by not staying in a hotel. I had to deal with her at every turn telling me &#39;so remember that time you kept losing your keys? Do you have a system yet? Man. You were a shocker. Has she gotten better with losing her phone? Hhmmm...Adam your hair has gotten so grey. Is it cause you live with teesh? Hey teesh what are you doing? Why are you doing that? Typical teesh...off with the fairies.&#39; There were other...what I will call behaviours as well. And I was angry. But it didn&#39;t get taken out on her. It was this horrible cycle of my boyfriend and I taking it out on eachtoher, the resentment I had for him for putting me in this position, and the way both of us had this generalised anger that if the poor kids did things that overtired kids on holidays do...they got yelled at severely. And it wasn&#39;t their fault. They were kids. <br>So.....I got angry. Angry at myself for not respecting my own boundaries. Angry at being put in this position. Angry at pretending my partner hasn&#39;t built a relationship with his dad over the last few years...but we can&#39;t say anything about that cause she hates him. Angry that my kids might hear these poison words. And I had my first panic attack in 6 years. Medication keeps it at bay....but she got so bad that I couldn&#39;t breathe. <br>Turning the other cheek? Doesn&#39;t work with this lady. But turning the other cheek hurts other people to. Why should they have suffer because we &#39;forgive&#39; her? When she has no desire to change? If this is where forgiveness and being a polite person gets you...I&#39;d rather be a Karen. Just...not to people that don&#39;t deserve it. Least of all my kids. And that&#39;s the thing...I am definitely not saying your life is incomplete without kids and you neber truly know yourself unless you have kids. It was just my journey...but when it only affected me (sort of...) it didn&#39;t seem like a problem. But when kids are designed to push your every button....you start to realise that if yiu don&#39;t look after yourself, no one can look after them. Ianger it&#39;s isn&#39;t the problem....once I started confronting bullies at work I got really good at defending new nurses that at the moment...we definitely can&#39;t afford to be eaten alive. That was purely driven by my anger. They want you to think that you are sinful for having anger...but that toxic anger comes from not directing where it needs to go and using it constructively.

Nothing was done and it was brushed under the rug so to speak. I was expected to go on as if all was normal. Later in life when I was face to face with them as an adult, they apologized which I do understand that most survivors of sa never get. However, not only was I expected by family members to forgive them in that moment, but I was rejected by family when I drew the line and said that they could not be in the same room or building as myself and I would leave if they came around.

The preachers who do this are not in it for the souls they might save. They are in it for their own satisfaction. They are in it to see the many tearful faces are looking back at them from the congregation. Aside from what ever damage any of those people came into that place with, they will be leaving with an even bigger wound and a command to heal it by doing something close to impossible, without any instructions on how to do it.<br><br>Forgiveness is something you do for yourself.

The church deliberately turned a blind eye and the people mentoring me told me that it was my fault and that me being angry because I was being abused was sin. They pressured me so much with this rhetoric that I ended up apologizing to my abuser for being upset at him for abusing me. You know why happened? He kept abusing me.

,,,,"One of the things that really challenged my faith back when I was a Christian was finding out that my parents didn&#39;t get divorced because they fell out of love, but because my father cheated on my mother multiple times, including with someone at their workplace. I felt so angry. Firstly, I was enraged that he would treat my mother that way. Secondly, I was angry at how he tore our family apart, including because his brothers, my uncles, defended him relentlessly. And thirdly, I was upset that when confronted about it, my father talked in circles to avoid having to outright say that it happened. He has always called it, &quot;what happened with your mother.&quot; I really thought I wouldn&#39;t be able to have a relationship with him after that. But my mother felt that it was important for us to continue that relationship and she said that even if my father didn&#39;t love her, he loved my sister and I and was a good father. Now, I don&#39;t see how cheating on your spouse doesn&#39;t make you a bad father, but I did move past it and I do have a relationship still with my father. But I do so because the person that was wronged, my mother, requested it. And I can&#39;t say that I ever forgave him for doing that. I think there&#39;s a big difference between forgiving someone and moving past it. And I&#39;m currently grappling with whether or not I should tell his current girlfriend about this. It&#39;s possible she might already know, but if she doesn&#39;t, it just feels like warning her that if he has done it once, he could do it again, just feels like the right thing to do.",UC4uu4lp8h0MC3Y1W9M6GBZg,2023-01-11T12:21:06Z
